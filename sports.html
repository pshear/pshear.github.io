          <p >I have been doing gymnastics since I was seven years old, and it has become a huge part of my life. Through the years, I have met many of my closest friends in the gym, creating bonds that go beyond just training together. I compete in gymnastics, and my favorite events are vault and floor. Vault involves sprinting down a runway, launching off a springboard, and performing a skill over the vaulting table, requiring speed, power, and precision. Floor is a combination of tumbling, dance, and artistry performed on a spring floor, allowing for both powerful acrobatics and expressive movement. Gymnastics has not only helped me grow as an athlete but has also shaped who I am today.

          <p class="story">In gymnastics, routines are scored based on difficulty and execution. Each routine has a Start Value (D-score), which reflects the difficulty of the skills performed, and an Execution Score (E-score), which starts at 10.0 and is reduced for mistakes like form breaks, wobbles, or falls. The final score is the sum of the D-score and E-score, with deductions subtracted for errors. Gymnasts compete at meets, which are competitions where they perform their routines in front of judges who evaluate their performances based on strict guidelines. Judges analyze each skill, checking for proper form, control, and precision while applying deductions for errors such as bent knees, unpointed toes, or falls. Scores are then compared to determine rankings and winners. Meets can range from small local competitions to major national and international events, including the Olympics.</p>

          <p class="story">This year, I started cheer at Lane, and it has been an amazing experience. As a back spot, I play a crucial role in keeping my flyers safe and making sure stunts stay solid. At first, I was nervous about joining, but the team was so welcoming, and I quickly made friends who have become like family. From long practices perfecting our routines to cheering at games, Iâ€™ve built strong bonds with my teammates. The adrenaline of hitting a clean stunt and the excitement of performing in front of a crowd make all the hard work worth it. Cheer has not only improved my strength and confidence but has also given me unforgettable memories and friendships.</p>
