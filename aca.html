One of the ways we make a difference is by creating goody bags filled with small gifts, snacks, and uplifting notes to brighten their day. It’s a simple but meaningful way to let them know they’re not alone and that people care about them. Being part of this club has been a rewarding experience, allowing me to give back and spread kindness to those who need it most.</p>
